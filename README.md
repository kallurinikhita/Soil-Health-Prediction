The goal of this project is to predict the soil organic matter content, and therefore soil quality.

Why? 
Soil fertility is important because it determines how well crops will grow, and how much nutritional content there is in the crops produced. As climate change is disrupting natural nutrient cycling and our soil quality is worsening due to destructive farming practices, it is important to understand what factors can improve soil health. Soil is the basis of our economy as it provides livelihoods for farmers, and the basis for our health and well-being as it provides us with the food we need. Through this project, I hope to understand what specific variables can result in the most fertile soil, therefore helping farmers and producing healthy crops.

Goals of this Project: 

With this project, I hope to explore what factors are most significant to determining organic matter content in soil based on the best performing model. With this information, and whether these variables are negatively correlated or positively correlated with soil organic matter content, I will be able to determine what factors and their corresponding magnitudes most affect organic matter content of soil.

Data used for this Project: 

Then data used in this project was obtained from Mendeley Data in the following website: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/r7tjn68rmw/1. The data set I will be working with includes data on factors that affect soil fertility in Grevena, a municipality in Northern Greece, where weather conditions are not optimal for crop output. As a result, soil organic matter content will not be reflective of other regions where farming might occur. However, this will provide valuable information on variables that affect soil health, even in areas not optimal for agriculture.
